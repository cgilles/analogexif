BUGS
* When typing long user-defined XMP schema prefix the Options dialog window resizes
* Selection clears when finished editing meta data value in the gear template
* Icon provider on the filelist sometimes caches icons
* For selected empty directories "Auto-fill exposures" and "Copy metadata" actions are not disabled
* memory leaks
* for extra long comments metadataview changes appearance
* incorrect setWindowModified() on main window
* when copying metadata and destination is one file, copied tags flicker as "dirty" for a moment
* when auto-filling exposure number and asking for backup - metadata of the changed file may be reflected in the metadata view
* handle all unsuccessfull returns
* in the equipment template edit, when tag flags checkboxes and line edit got swapped out, editor does not close properly when loses focus
* [Mac] local 8-bit exif string values are still stored as UTF-8 (toLocal8Bit() returns UTF-8) - fix by prohibiting local characters?
* When pasting Google map coordinates cursor should be on the first character to pass the validator
